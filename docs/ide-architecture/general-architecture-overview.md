# General Architecture Overview


![Docusaurus logo](/img/webview-diagram.png)

**Motivation**

- **Core Objective:** The primary goal of this extension is to enable users to leverage VS Code's web version while preserving the convenience of straightforward updates and avoiding conflicts with the original VS Code source code.

**Extending VS Code**

- **Leveraging Webview API:** To seamlessly augment VS Code's native views, we employ the Webview API provided by VS Code. Each webview instance maintains a distinct control panel for loading scripts and necessary assets. In our case, this panel handles loading the output script generated by your React build process. Additionally, you can configure this panel to manage messages received from the view layer and transmit them back as needed.

**Communication Channels**

- **Post-Message Pattern:** Communication within the VS Code extension relies on the post-message pattern to facilitate message exchange between the logic and view layers within separate panels or while executing commands registered in other application sections.

**Key Features**

- **Workspaces (Projects):** Workspaces, also referred to as projects, represent file system-related entities. They encompass your project's files and currently opened tabs.
- **Browser Memory File System:** This file system is created using the File System Provider API and implemented with `vscode.globalStore` to serialize files and store them within an IndexedDB database.
- **Home Page (Welcome Webview):** This serves as the initial webview that users encounter upon launching the extension, providing an introductory or welcome experience.
- **Compiler Tab:** This tab furnishes users with the ability to compile their contracts locally, eliminating the need for a web server or potentially enhancing compilation speed by taking advantage of their local Docker setup.
